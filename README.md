Gnome Shell Extension: Provide SSH search results in overview

Very heavily inspired by: https://github.com/brot/gnome-shell-extension-sshsearch. I am trying this "project" to learn about software development in general and the java script and gnome shell extensions in particular. My aim is to get this SSH search results working for GNOME Shell 3.26.
